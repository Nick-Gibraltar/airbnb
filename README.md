AI Core Data Science Specialisation Project - Airbnb Data Modelling

The Airbnb data modelling project aims to teach data science skills through the analysis of data from Airbnb.

Milestones 1 and 2 set up the environment for the project and provide a high-level overview of the system to be built.

Milestone 3 requires some simple code to be written to prepare the data for analysis. The code, contained in the module tabular_data.py, loads data previously downloaded from Amazon AWS into a Pandas dataframe.
Some simple processing is executed as follows: (a) remove rows with certain missing data; (b) concatenate descriptive text that has the appearance of a Python list into a string; and (c) fill in certain items of missing data.
